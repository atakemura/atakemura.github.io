# About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (Tokyo, Japan) and Department of Informatics, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, [SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/) (Tokyo, Japan) (2019-Present), working with [Prof. Katsumi Inoue](https://research.nii.ac.jp/il).
I obtained my Master's degree in Chemistry (2012) from the [University of York (York, UK)](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/), where my project investigated intermolecular forces.

I am currently a [R&D Manager](https://www.intageholdings.co.jp/rd/english/) at [INTAGE Inc.](https://www.intage.co.jp/english/), having previously held roles as a Data Scientist and Project Manager (2012-Present).
